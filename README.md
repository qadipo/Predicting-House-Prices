# Predicting-House-Prices

# Overview
A company wishes to understand the factors that affect house prices from a given dataset that has been collected over the years. The company further wishes to build a model that will help in accurately pricing newly built houses.

Therefore, this work shall focus on:
  1. Studying the factors that affect housing prices from the data collected, &
  2. Prediction of selling price of house from predictor variables
  
To **establish the factors that affect the price of a house** univariate, bivariate and mutivariate exploratory data analysis shall be employed. 

To further **predict the price of a newly built house** regression techniques shall be employed. The follollowing specific techniques shall be considered:
  1. Multiple Linear Regression
  2. Quantile Regression
  3. Ridge Regression
  4. Lasso Regression
  5. Elastic Net Regression
  
Additionally, the performances of each of the above regression techniques shall be evaluated for suitability in predicting house prics.
